## I. Priority: Increase MCV1 Administration

### A. Summary of Evidence

| Finding | Value | Confidence |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Causal effect of MCV1 | -0.0230 | **High** (E-value: 1.12) |
| 10% coverage increase → incidence reduction | ~21% | Robust to refutation |
| Strongest effects | High-Income (-4.6%), Low-Income (-3.1%) | Consistent |

### B. Targeted Recommendations by Income Group

#### Low-Income Countries (25 countries, current effect: -3.1% per 1% coverage)

**Primary Barriers**: Supply, cold chain, healthcare access

| Intervention | Expected Impact | Implementation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Cold chain strengthening | +5-10% coverage | Infrastructure investment, solar refrigeration |
| Mobile vaccination units | +3-5% coverage | Reach remote populations |
| Community health worker training | +2-4% coverage | Integrate vaccination into primary care |
| Birth registration integration | +1-2% coverage | Capture children at birth |

**Target**: Reach 95% MCV1 coverage (current average ~74%)

#### Lower Middle-Income Countries (49 countries, effect: -1.5% per 1% coverage)

**Primary Barriers**: Mixed supply/demand, geographic variation

| Intervention | Expected Impact | Implementation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| School-based catch-up campaigns | +3-5% coverage | Target missed children |
| Private sector engagement | +2-3% coverage | Expand delivery channels |
| Conditional cash transfers | +1-3% coverage | Incentivize completion |
| SMS reminder systems | +1-2% coverage | Reduce dropout rates |

#### Upper Middle-Income Countries (52 countries, effect: -0.7% per 1% coverage)

**Primary Barriers**: Complacency, emerging hesitancy

| Intervention | Expected Impact | Implementation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Provider recommendation training | +1-2% coverage | Strengthen confidence |
| Social media engagement | Maintain coverage | Counter misinformation |
| School mandate policies | +2-3% coverage | Where politically feasible |

#### High-Income Countries (63 countries, effect: -4.6% per 1% coverage)

**Primary Barriers**: Hesitancy, pockets of under-vaccination

| Intervention | Expected Impact | Implementation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Targeted outreach to under-vaccinated communities | +1-2% coverage | Culturally appropriate messaging |
| Mandates for childcare/school entry | +2-5% coverage | Policy enforcement |
| Healthcare worker vaccination | Maintain confidence | Lead by example |
| Transparent adverse event communication | Maintain trust | Build vaccine confidence |

## II. Address Vaccine Hesitancy

### A. Summary of Evidence

| Finding | Value | Interpretation |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Effect on MCV1 | -0.23% per 1% hesitancy | Each 1% reduction in hesitancy → 0.23% more coverage |
| Direct effect on incidence | +0.18% per 1% hesitancy | Small but consistent |
| Data quality | 84% imputed | **Major limitation** |

### B. Key Insight: Selection Effect

> "Those who overcome hesitancy to receive MCV1 are **more likely** to complete MCV2 (+13% completion rate vs. expected)"

**Policy Implication**: Focus resources on converting the hesitant to get their **first dose**—subsequent completion is more likely.

### C. Hesitancy Reduction Strategies

#### Information-Based Interventions

| Strategy | Target Audience | Evidence Base |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Provider communication training** | Healthcare workers | Strong: provider recommendation is key driver |
| **Transparent safety communication** | General public | Moderate: builds trust |
| **Social media monitoring & response** | Online audiences | Growing: counter misinformation |
| **Community leader engagement** | Traditional communities | Strong: trusted voices matter |

#### Structural Interventions

| Strategy | Target Population | Evidence Base |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Convenient access** (extended hours, multiple locations) | Working parents | Strong: reduces practical barriers |
| **Co-location with other services** | All families | Moderate: reduces opportunity cost |
| **Reduce out-of-pocket costs** | Low-income families | Strong: financial barriers significant |

#### Policy Interventions

| Strategy | Context | Considerations |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **School/childcare mandates** | Where socially acceptable | Effective but may increase vocal opposition |
| **Insurance incentives** | Private sector | Can increase uptake without mandates |
| **Reminder/recall systems** | Universal | Low-cost, effective |

### D. Data Improvement Priority

**Critical Gap**: Vaccine hesitancy data missing for 84-88% of observations, concentrated in Low and Lower-Middle Income countries.

**Recommendations**:
1. Include vaccine confidence questions in national health surveys
2. Integrate hesitancy monitoring into routine immunization programs
3. Conduct periodic multinational surveys (similar to Wellcome Global Monitor)
4. Develop standardized measurement tools for cross-country comparison

## III. E-Value Interpretation for Policymakers

### What the E-Value Tells Us

| Statistic | Value | Plain Language |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| E-value (point estimate) | 1.12 | To nullify the MCV1 effect, an unmeasured factor would need to be 12% stronger than any measured factor |
| Largest observed confounder | 1.04 | Political stability has the strongest confounding effect |

### Confidence in Causal Claims

**Strong confidence** that MCV1 causes reduced measles incidence because:
1. ✓ Effect survives adjustment for 8 confounders
2. ✓ Effect stable across random subsets
3. ✓ Effect disappears with placebo treatment
4. ✓ E-value exceeds all observed confounders

**Moderate confidence** in exact effect sizes because:
1. ⚠ Some variables heavily imputed
2. ⚠ Ecological fallacy possible
3. ⚠ Temporal dynamics not fully captured

## IV. Implementation Priorities

### Short-Term (0-12 months)

1. **Strengthen MCV1 delivery in Low-Income Countries**
   - Focus on cold chain and outreach
   - Estimated impact: 5-10% coverage increase

2. **Train healthcare providers on recommendation**
   - Evidence-based communication
   - Address hesitant parents effectively

3. **Establish baseline hesitancy surveillance**
   - Add questions to existing surveys
   - Enable evidence-based targeting

### Medium-Term (1-3 years)

1. **School-based catch-up campaigns**
   - Target children who missed routine vaccination
   - Focus on Lower-Middle Income Countries

2. **Social media monitoring infrastructure**
   - Track vaccine misinformation
   - Rapid response capability

3. **Policy evaluation**
   - Assess mandate effectiveness where implemented
   - Share best practices

### Long-Term (3-5 years)

1. **Reach and maintain 95% coverage globally**
   - Critical for herd immunity
   - Address remaining pockets of under-vaccination

2. **Integrate hesitancy research into routine surveillance**
   - Understand evolving attitudes
   - Adapt messaging accordingly

## V. Monitoring and Evaluation Framework

### Key Performance Indicators

| Indicator | Baseline | Target | Monitoring |
|-----------|----------|--------|------------|
| Global MCV1 coverage | 84% (2023) | 95% | Annual WUENIC |
| Low-Income MCV1 coverage | 74% | 90% | Annual WUENIC |
| Measles incidence (global) | Varies | <5 per million | WHO surveillance |
| Countries with hesitancy data | ~50 | 150+ | Survey coverage |

### Expected Outcomes

Based on causal estimates, if interventions achieve targets:

| Scenario | Coverage Change | Expected Incidence Reduction |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Global +5% MCV1 | 84% → 89% | ~10% reduction |
| Global +10% MCV1 | 84% → 94% | ~21% reduction |
| Low-Income +15% MCV1 | 74% → 89% | ~38% reduction in LICs |

## VI. Limitations and Caveats

1. **Causal estimates based on observational data** — E-values suggest moderate robustness but randomized trials would provide stronger evidence

2. **Country-level analysis** — Effects may vary within countries; subnational data needed for targeted implementation

3. **Vaccine hesitancy data quality** — Heavy imputation limits confidence in hesitancy-specific recommendations

4. **Time period (2012-2024)** — Results reflect historical patterns; future contexts may differ
