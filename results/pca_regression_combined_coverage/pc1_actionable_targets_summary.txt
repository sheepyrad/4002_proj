PC1 MAPPED COEFFICIENT ANALYSIS SUMMARY
=======================================

Top 3 Actionable Targets (by frequency in top 3 across all years):
1. GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2021 international $) - appeared in top 3 for 10 year(s)
2. Birth Rate - appeared in top 3 for 9 year(s)
3. Average household size (number of members) - appeared in top 3 for 9 year(s)

Note: Mapped coefficient = PC1_regression_coefficient × PC1_loading
This represents the contribution of each original factor to measles incidence through PC1.
