PCA COEFFICIENTS ANALYSIS SUMMARY
============================================================

Top 3 Factors by Principal Component (based on frequency in top 3 coefficients across all years):

PC1:
------------------------------------------------------------
  1. GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2021 international $) - appeared in top 3 for 10 year(s)
  2. Birth Rate - appeared in top 3 for 9 year(s)
  3. Average household size (number of members) - appeared in top 3 for 9 year(s)

PC2:
------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Net Migration - appeared in top 3 for 9 year(s)
  2. Public health expenditure as a share of GDP - appeared in top 3 for 7 year(s)
  3. Share that disagrees vaccines are effective - appeared in top 3 for 6 year(s)

PC3:
------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Population Density - appeared in top 3 for 9 year(s)
  2. Net Migration - appeared in top 3 for 9 year(s)
  3. Share that disagrees vaccines are effective - appeared in top 3 for 4 year(s)

Note: Mapped coefficients = PC_regression_coefficient × PC_loading
This represents the contribution of each original factor to measles incidence through the PC.
Top 3 factors are identified by absolute mapped coefficient value for each year, then counted across all years.
