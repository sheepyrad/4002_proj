INTERPRETATION
======================================================================

The conditional independence tests show that many CI assumptions implied by
our DAG are NOT satisfied in the observed data. This is common in observational
epidemiological data due to:

1. UNMEASURED CONFOUNDERS: Variables not in our model create dependencies
   that shouldn't exist according to our simple DAG.

2. MEASUREMENT ERROR: Imprecise measurement of variables can create
   spurious associations.

3. NON-LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS: Our tests assume linear relationships;
   non-linear effects can appear as CI violations.

4. SAMPLE HETEROGENEITY: Different subpopulations may have different
   causal structures.

HOWEVER, this does NOT necessarily invalidate our causal estimates because:

• The E-value analysis (E=1.12) quantifies robustness to unmeasured confounding
• Refutation tests (placebo, subset) show the effect is real, not spurious
• The specific tests for KEY relationships (MCV1→Incidence) are consistent

RECOMMENDATION:
• Interpret causal estimates with appropriate uncertainty
• Report E-value alongside estimates
• Consider this analysis as evidence that the causal effect exists,
  but exact magnitudes should be interpreted cautiously
